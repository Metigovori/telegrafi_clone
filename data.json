The decision follows international pressure to allow the safe passage of civilians and aid but the shaky truce has not so far stopped the clashes. In statements, both sides accused the other of violations. The agreement has deescalated the fighting in some areas but violence continues to push civilians to flee. Aid groups have also struggled to get badly needed supplies into the country.","url":"https:\/\/www.arabnews.com\/node\/2295486\/middle-east","source":"arabnews","image":null,"category":"general","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2023-05-01T00:36:07+00:00"
